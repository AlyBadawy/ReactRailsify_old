  # == Controller Filters
  #
  # You can add before, after and around filters to all of your
  # Active Admin resources and pages from here.
  #
  # config.before_action :do_something_awesome

  # == Localize Date/Time Format
  #
  # Set the localize format to display dates and times.
  # To understand how to localize your app with I18n, read more at
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html
  #
  # You can run `bin/rails runner 'puts I18n.t("date.formats")'` to see the
  # available formats in your application.
  #
  config.localize_format = :long

  # == Meta Tags
  #
  # Add additional meta tags to the head element of active admin pages.
  #
  # Add tags to all pages logged in users see:
  #   config.meta_tags = { author: 'My Company' }

  # By default, sign up/sign in/recover password pages are excluded
  # from showing up in search engine results by adding a robots meta
  # tag. You can reset the hash of meta tags included in logged out
  # pages:
  #   config.meta_tags_for_logged_out_pages = {}

  # == Removing Breadcrumbs
  #
  # Breadcrumbs are enabled by default. You can customize them for individual
  # resources or you can disable them globally from here.
  #
  # config.breadcrumb = false

  # == Register Stylesheets & Javascripts
  #
  # We recommend using the built in Active Admin layout and loading
  # up your own stylesheets / javascripts to customize the look
  # and feel.
  #
  # To load a stylesheet:
  #   config.register_stylesheet 'my_stylesheet.css'
  #
  # You can provide an options hash for more control, which is passed along to stylesheet_link_tag():
  #   config.register_stylesheet 'my_print_stylesheet.css', media: :print
  #
  # To load a javascript file:
  #   config.register_javascript 'my_javascript.js'

  # == CSV options
  #
  # Set the CSV builder separator
  # config.csv_options = { col_sep: ';' }
  #
  # Force the use of quotes
  # config.csv_options = { force_quotes: true }

  # == Menu System
  #
  # You can add a navigation menu to be used in your application, or configure a provided menu
  #
  # To change the default utility navigation to show a link to your website & a logout btn
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.build_menu :utility_navigation do |menu|
  #       menu.add label: "My Great Website", url: "http://www.mygreatwebsite.com", html_options: { target: :blank }
  #       admin.add_logout_button_to_menu menu
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # If you wanted to add a static menu item to the default menu provided:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     admin.build_menu :default do |menu|
  #       menu.add label: "My Great Website", url: "http://www.mygreatwebsite.com", html_options: { target: :blank }
  #     end
  #   end

  # == Download Links
  #
  # You can disable download links on resource listing pages,
  # or customize the formats shown per namespace/globally
  #
  # To disable/customize for the :admin namespace:
  #
  #   config.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #
  #     # Disable the links entirely
  #     admin.download_links = false
  #
  #     # Only show XML & PDF options
  #     admin.download_links = [:xml, :pdf]
  #
  #     # Enable/disable the links based on block
  #     #   (for example, with cancan)
  #     admin.download_links = proc { can?(:view_download_links) }
  #
  #   end

  # == Pagination
  #
  # Pagination is enabled by default for all resources.
  # You can control the default per page count for all resources here.
  #
  # config.default_per_page = 30
  #
  # You can control the max per page count too.
  #
  # config.max_per_page = 10_000

  # == Filters
  #
  # By default the index screen includes a "Filters" sidebar on the right
  # hand side with a filter for each attribute of the registered model.
  # You can enable or disable them for all resources here.
  #
  # config.filters = true
  #
  # By default the filters include associations in a select, which means
  # that every record will be loaded for each association (up
  # to the value of config.maximum_association_filter_arity).
  # You can enabled or disable the inclusion
  # of those filters by default here.
  #
  # config.include_default_association_filters = true

  # config.maximum_association_filter_arity = 256 # default value of :unlimited will change to 256 in a future version
  # config.filter_columns_for_large_association = [
  #    :display_name,
  #    :full_name,
  #    :name,
  #    :username,
  #    :login,
  #    :title,
  #    :email,
  #  ]
  # config.filter_method_for_large_association = '_starts_with'

  # == Head
  #
  # You can add your own content to the site head like analytics. Make sure
  # you only pass content you trust.
  #
  # config.head = ''.html_safe

  # == Footer
  #
  # By default, the footer shows the current Active Admin version. You can
  # override the content of the footer here.
  #
  config.footer = 'Build by <a href="https://alybadawy.com" target="_blank">Aly Badawy</a>'.html_safe

  # == Sorting
  #
  # By default ActiveAdmin::OrderClause is used for sorting logic
  # You can inherit it with own class and inject it for all resources
  #
  # config.order_clause = MyOrderClause
